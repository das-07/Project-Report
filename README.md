# LINEAR - CROSS AND LINEAR - CIRCULAR REFLECTIVE TYPE POLARIZER FOR SUB-THZ REGIME

A project on the ultrawideband high-efficiency reflective type meta-surface based polarization converter in collaboration with IIT Palakkad
Applicable in Stealth Technology.

The polarization converter mainly converts the linearly polarized beam into the crosspolarized beam and circularly polarized beam. In this paper, the design of a reflective type
linear-linear and linear-circular polarization converter at the sub-THz frequency regime is
detailed. The designed unit cell of reflective polarizer consists of four squares at each
corner with a long bar placed diagonally joining two squares printed on the top of
polyamide substrate terminated with the gold ground on the other side. Post simulation
results show a linearly polarized (x/y) incident wave converted to its cross (y/x) component
in three frequency bands (0.46- 0.50THz, 1.08- 1.57THz, and 2.00 -2.02 THz) after
reflection. The reflected wave would also be circularly polarized in five different frequency
bands (0.43-0.45 THz, 0.53-0.94THz,1.61-1.64 THz, 1.96-1.99 THz, and 2.04-2.06 THz).
The proposed structure has a unit-cell periodicity of 0.28 λL and an effective thickness of
0.0026 λL, where λl is the operating frequency. For linear-cross conversion, the proposed
design exhibits a stable response up to 40°, while for linear-circular conversion, it shows a
stable response up to 30°. The authors believe that the proposed geometry offers various
benefits, including simplicity, compactness, and angular stability. It is employed in realtime applications such as polarization beam splitters and time-domain spectroscopy, where
conversions are the most important factor.
